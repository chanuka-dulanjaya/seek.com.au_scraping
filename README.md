This script automates job scraping from Seek.com.au using Selenium. 
It opens the website, searches for IT jobs, and extracts job details (title, company, location, link) from job postings on the first 10 pages. 
It handles dynamic content by waiting for elements to load and clicking the "Next" button to navigate through pages. 
The extracted data is saved into a CSV file. 
It also includes logging for tracking the script's progress and error handling for timeouts and exceptions.
